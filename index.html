		<h2>Hunter</h2>
		<p>The Hunter is a Guardian class which specializes in agility. Hunters are "quick on the trigger and deadly with a blade," so much so that they have earned a fearful reputation and are known as the "Masters of the Frontier."</p>

	<h3>Titan</h3>
		<p>Titans can be distinguished by their heavy, full-body armor and swept-back helmets. The Titan's unique armor piece is a mark, a piece of cloth worn on the right hip intended to show their allegiance, lineage, or achievements.</p>

		<h2>Warlock</h2>
		<p>In appearance, Warlocks can be distinguished by their rounded helmets and long vestments. As with the other player classes, in addition to head, chest armor, gauntlets, and leg armor, they have a special fifth armor slot that is unique to their class and further helps to distinguish them from their brethren in arms: a bond (armband) worn on the upper-left arm.</p>
